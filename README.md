# Numpy-Tutorial


This tutoruial trys to highlight the basic concepts of numpy 

For performing sophisticated mathematical calculations, Python's NumPy external library provides a basic level library. NumPy uses multi-dimensional array objects to overcome slower executions. It comes with built-in routines for working with arrays.


**Applications of Numpy **
1. A Python substitute for lists and arrays
        In Numpy, arrays are what lists are in Python. The Numpy arrays are homogeneous sets of elements, similar to lists in Python. The fact that NumPy arrays are homogenous in nature is their key characteristic.
        
        
 

This sets them apart from Python arrays. For mathematical operations, it ensures homogeneity, which is not achievable with heterogeneous materials. The fact that many different functions may be applied to NumPy arrays is another advantage of using these arrays.



2.** NumPy keeps very little memory.**
        In NumPy, arrays are objects. According to the needs, Python continually deletes and generates these objects. As a result, less memory is allocated than using Python lists. There are tools in NumPy to prevent memory leaks in the data buffer.
        It has features like copies, views, and indexing that significantly reduce memory usage. Indexing makes it possible to reuse data by bringing up the original array's view. Additionally, it provides data type information for the elements, which results in code optimization.



3.** Making multi-dimensional arrays with NumPy**
        In NumPy, we can also build multidimensional arrays. There are numerous rows and columns in these arrays. These arrays are multi-dimensional because they have more than one column. Matrix construction is implemented by multi-dimensional arrays.

These matrices are easy to work with. With the use of matrices the code also becomes memory efficient. We have a matrix module to perform various operations on these matrices.
