# Numpy-Tutorial


This tutoruial trys to highlight the basic concepts of numpy 

For performing sophisticated mathematical calculations, Python's NumPy external library provides a basic level library. NumPy uses multi-dimensional array objects to overcome slower executions. It comes with built-in routines for working with arrays.


**Applications of Numpy **
1. A Python substitute for lists and arrays
        In Numpy, arrays are what lists are in Python. The Numpy arrays are homogeneous sets of elements, similar to lists in Python. The fact that NumPy arrays are homogenous in nature is their key characteristic.

This sets them apart from Python arrays. For mathematical operations, it ensures homogeneity, which is not achievable with heterogeneous materials. The fact that many different functions may be applied to NumPy arrays is another advantage of using these arrays.

2.** NumPy keeps very little memory.**
        In NumPy, arrays are objects. According to the needs, Python continually deletes and generates these objects. As a result, less memory is allocated than using Python lists. There are tools in NumPy to prevent memory leaks in the data buffer.
